2. Honest-Calculator
3. Hangman game. Medium level difficulty on the site. My second comleted project on JetBrains Academy. Actually was really hard for me. It calculates 2 values you put in it separated by spaces using +, -, /, * operators. For example. 2 + 2 or 4 * 4 also if you press "y" when it asks you if you want to remember the result of calculation it will be stored and remembered until you press "n".
